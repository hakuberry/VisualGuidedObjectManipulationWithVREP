The "object_manipulation_tasks.py" file trains and predicts the position of an object within a VREP environment.  The VREP environment used is "object_manipulation_tasks.ttt".
The VREP scene must be opened and simulated first before running the "object_manipulation_tasks.py".  Current implementation lacks save and restore feature due to issues with weights not loading correctly.
